## concept

The query builder/submitter could look like
http://europepmc.org/advancesearch
which has an interactively created, editable, query text box (Under "Advanced Search")

? do we wat explicit "AND/OR", etc. I suspect not.
## building

The query should be built from components, currently of the types:

 * simple text box (query text)
 * check box (multiple selection)  (e.g. for journals or dictionaries)
 * radiobutton (to select single option).
